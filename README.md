This python code models the use and recovery of work capacity above critical speed (D') during interval training running session with pre determined end (e.g. 8x200m with 90s recovery). 

You need to input CS, D' and each repetition speed. 

Tau is determined interactively (you need to guess it until you get it right). 

You can adapt the code to any interval training structure. 

The Interval training session MUST be performed till exhaustion.

If you are having any issues to understand the concept, the following article is a good place to begin: DOI: 10.1007/s40279-017-0688-0
